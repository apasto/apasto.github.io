      <description>Consider some image-like data (in the form of a &amp;ldquo;grid&amp;rdquo;, a labelled 2-D array) which can be explained at least in part by another observable. Suppose that this relationship is linear - or can be approximated as such - and varies spatially, with a spatial scale that is larger than the grid interval. Pending some other assumptions, we can invert this relationship in discrete windows: a rolling 2-D linear regression.</description>

      <description>I am pre-dating this post with its original date, from 2014. It has been migrated from an old blog of mine (now a dead link). This has been a fun, rather noisy project. Not much to showcase, but I cannot find any reason to get rid of it either.&#xA;A bash script to turn an RSS news feed in escape-formatted dot-matrix printer text. Or: a questionable waste of time, continuous-form paper, and ink ribbon.</description>
