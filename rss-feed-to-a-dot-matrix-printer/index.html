    </header><p>This little project has turned out as fun as it&rsquo;s been noisy (rather).
Not much to showcase, but I cannot find any reason to get rid of it either.</p>
<p>A bash script to turn an RSS news feed in escape-formatted dot-matrix printer text.
Or: a questionable waste of time, continuous-form paper, and ink ribbon.</p>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>Quoting the video caption:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Those escape sequences that look like line noise are Epson ESC/P control codes, to which my printer (a Citizen 120D+) is partially compliant.</p>
<p>Someday, somehow, I’ll turn all those sed calls in a nice awk script. Apart from syntax cleanliness, a big issue is reverse ordering the <code>title-desc-pubDate</code> tuples so the newest headlines are printed last, both in the zero-time print and the updates. Feel free to edit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is definitely not the right way to do it and catching all the bad shell scripting practices may be a interesting code review exercise, now.
Anyway, this mess seems to be still working (see the comments on the YouTube video above).</p>
<p>More descriptive comments would have helped, particularly for all the escape codes (all those <code>\\e\\x</code>-something), which are in the printers own ESC/P dialect (from its original spiral-bound manual, of which I only had the French version - <a href="https://frinkiac.com/caption/S10E19/283899">relevant Simpsons quote</a>).
Nowadays I do not have this printer at hand (and I vowed to myself I won&rsquo;t be hoarding others) therefore further testing is out of the question :)</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the argument provided to <code>lpr -P</code>, variable <code>cups_raw_queue</code> (e.g. <code>lpt-raw</code>) should match the name of a local CUPS printer set as a raw queue on the parallel port (or adapter) device.
This is a feature which is planned to be deprecated, as of March 2018 - see cups issue <a href="https://github.com/apple/cups/issues/5271">#5271</a>.</p>
