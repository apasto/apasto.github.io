      <description>Consider some image-like data (in the form of a &amp;ldquo;grid&amp;rdquo;, a labelled 2-D array) which can be explained at least in part by another observable. Suppose that this relationship is linear - or can be approximated as such - and varies spatially, with a spatial scale that is larger than the grid interval. Pending some other assumptions, we can invert this relationship in discrete windows: a rolling 2-D linear regression.</description>
