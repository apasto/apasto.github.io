<p>Currently, I am a geophysics postdoc.</p>
<p>I have worked on signal simulation and detectability analysis in gravimetry, which is the use of gravity measurements
(and any disturbing signal with respect to a known reference) to sense the how mass is distributed (and moves) in a planetary body.
The topic lies between geophysics and geodesy, mainly - with considerable overlap with other disciplines.</p>
<p>In that context, simulating a signal (<em>forward modelling</em>) may be needed as step in defining an inverse problem (retrieving mass by knowing its gravity field, somewhere),
in achieving signal isolation through <em>reduction</em> of data from measurements (when more-or-less known signals are subtracted),
or even in assessing if new measurements (anything from a fieldwork campaign to a constellation of gravimetric satellites, think of the GRACE mission) can sense a signal or if is buried in noise.
In the last few years, I have been working on this last application, in support of the &ldquo;science segment&rdquo; of the performance assessment of different proposed mission concepts.</p>
<p>Concurrently, I have been busy with other kinds of numerical geo-models: the so-called thermomechanical modelling, to reconstruct how the crust and lithospheric mantle behaved beneath the southern portion of the Ross Sea, Antarctica, in response to extensional dynamics - part of
what we now call the West Antarctica Rift System.
Since I am so keen on gravity, I also took the role of turning geodynamical models into synthetic observations of gravity, in two projects.
Gravity observations carry less information than a whole model of density in the subsurface, due to superposition of the attraction of all masses and to the
ill-placed measurements themselves (outside the planet, for obvious reasons). Thus, forward-modelling these observations from a synthetic Earth model in which
we know everything may seem counterintuitive. However, gravity is often one of the few, if not the only, geophysical observables that we have in sparsely
surveyed areas. Modelling it allows to put ourserlves in a realistic interpretation settings, enabling and almost direct comparison between models and real data.</p>
<p>On top of that, I have a limited fieldwork experience (again, on measuring gravity) and an extensive record of keeping a regional tilt-strain measurement network running - which is
one of the ways of sensing the deformation of the Earth&rsquo;s crust, complementary to space geodesy (GNSS, InSAR),
Speaking of that, I am keenly curious about any other remote sensing technique.
Regarding InSAR, I had the pleasure of supporting some technical/infrastructural aspects of a doctoral project on Sentinel 1 data (some automation, migration to HPC), which sparked some collaterals
on the topic of mitigation of tropospheric delay.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s <em>work</em>.
This pages however serve the purpose of keeping track of stuff that, for the most part, is not work.</p>
